    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\"This dataset contains data for more than 9.5K cars sale in Ukraine. Most of them are used cars so it opens the possibility to analyze features related to car operation. This is a subset of all car data in Ukraine. Using this We will analyze the various parameters of used car sales in Ukraine.\""

    "# Introduction\n",
    "This Exploratory Data Analysis is to practice Python skills learned till now on a structured data set including loading, inspecting, wrangling, exploring, and drawing conclusions from data. The notebook has observations with each step in order to explain thoroughly how to approach the data set. Based on the observation some questions also are answered in the notebook for the reference though not all of them are explored in the analysis."

    "# Domain Knowledge\n",
    "* Price: The selling price of the car, which depends on various factors like brand, model, mileage, engine type, and year of manufacturing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Body Type: The structure of the car (e.g., sedan, hatchback, SUV, coupe, convertible, etc.), which affects market demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mileage: In the context of cars in Ukraine, \"mileage\" refers to the total distance a vehicle has traveled since it was new, typically measured in kilometers (km). and unit for this column is thousand kilometers (e.g. 68 = 68000KM)\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Mileage” refers to the average distance or number of kilometers your car can go on a given quantity of fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Engine Volume (engV): The engine displacement in liters (L). Higher engine volume usually means higher power but lower fuel efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Engine Type (engType): Fuel type of the engine:\n",
    "Petrol (Gasoline) – Common, high availability, and moderate cost.\n",
    "Diesel – Better mileage but higher maintenance and environmental concerns.\n",
    "Hybrid – A mix of fuel and electric power, improving fuel efficiency.\n",
    "Electric (EV) – Zero emissions and low running cost but higher initial price.\n",
    "LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas) – Alternative fuel that is cheaper but less common.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Registration: Whether the car has a valid registration.\n",
    "Registered cars have legal clearance and are easier to sell.\n",
    "Unregistered cars may require additional paperwork and legal checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Year:The year the car was manufactured. Older cars tend to be cheaper due to depreciation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model: The specific version of the car from the manufacturer.\n",
    " Some models hold value better due to reliability and brand reputation.\n",
    "* Drive Type =\n",
    "Full (All-Wheel Drive) = Power is delivered to all four wheels automatically, adjusting based on road conditions.\n",
    "Rear (Rear-Wheel Drive) = Power is delivered to the rear wheels, while the front wheels handle steering.\n",
